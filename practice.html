<h4> 1. The introdution of much of us somehow remind us each other </h4>

<p> It hasn't been that quite a long since I really got into programing in
computer. I don't know how I got into this, but one reason that broungt me
here was because of this impact. and that was something that I want to call
it effect of describing something around us. </p>

<h4> 2. What has been brought forth so fat? -> how to use </h4>

<p style ="margin-top:0px;"> I mean, I wasn't kind of person
who really had something to do with this field. As you can see the name of
my major at a university, it didn't have anyting in common to begin with.</p>

<h4> 3. Coming to terms with some other area we haven't been through </h4>

<p>Though it did, there was one thing running through my mind much more fastly
and this thougt never get me away. After that day, it feels like I found my
way to home. Ever since that thing happened, I barely can erase that memory.

If you're honest with what you has replied to us, we don't need to ask
for some other proves to get acqunated. <br>
Just right before you didn't come to your sense, we've seen a lot
out of your performance in which we could learn quite a lot!
most of which turned out to be meaningful!

I think the conncection between kids and their patents can have
just as much impanct on our growth as the nutrition itself, if not more.

Isn't it how we contribute to the world where we're livin in?
Much of what has been made of our earth is reminisecnt of how we live.
Depending on the size and how many people there will be can take
the majority of this.
