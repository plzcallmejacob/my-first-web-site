nternet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature,
 appearance or services a website offers, but should also describe the site in
  an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements,
  impact or historical significance, which can be kept significantly
  more up-to-date than most reference sources, since editors can incorporate
   new developments and facts as they are made known. See the Current events
    portal for examples.
